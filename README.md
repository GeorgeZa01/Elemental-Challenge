# Visio Fund Management Website Replica

This project is a pixel-perfect, fully responsive, and fully functional replica of the [Visio Fund Management](https://www.visiofund.co.za/) website, created as part of the Elemental Web Development Challenge.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this challenge was to accurately reproduce the Visio website using **only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery** — without the use of any frontend frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or React.

This replica includes:
- Fully structured HTML reflecting the layout and content of the original site
- Custom CSS for precise styling and responsive design
- JavaScript and jQuery used for interactive elements, such as sliders and menu toggles
- Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Pixel-perfect layout matching the original Visio site
- 📱 Fully responsive design across all devices
- 🔄 JavaScript-powered image slider (homepage banner)
- 🔍 Smooth navigation and menu toggle functionality
- 💡 Clean, well-commented code for readability and scalability

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom styling, media queries for responsiveness)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- jQuery (for DOM manipulation and interactivity)
